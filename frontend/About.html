            <h2>Welcome to IP Tracker</h2>
            <p>
                In today’s digital age, understanding your network is more crucial than ever. 
                Our IP Tracker tool provides a simple yet powerful way to gain insights into IP addresses. 
                Whether you’re a network administrator, a cybersecurity professional, or simply curious about 
                your own internet connection, IP Tracker is here to help you navigate the complexities of IP addresses.
            </p>

            <h2>What is IP Tracker?</h2>
            <p>
                IP Tracker is a web-based application that allows users to track the geographical location of any IP address 
                in real-time. With just a few clicks, you can uncover valuable information about the IP's origin, including 
                the country, region, city, ISP (Internet Service Provider), and more. Our platform is designed for ease of use, 
                ensuring that even those with limited technical knowledge can effectively utilize it.
            </p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                Using advanced geolocation technology and the <strong>ipinfo.io</strong> API, our IP Tracker retrieves detailed 
                information related to an IP address. Here’s a brief overview of how the process works:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>User Input:</strong> Simply enter the IP address you want to track into our user-friendly interface.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Retrieval:</strong> Our system sends a request to the <strong>ipinfo.io</strong> API, fetching the 
                    relevant data associated with that IP.</li>
                <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> The retrieved information is then displayed on an interactive map, providing 
                    a clear visual representation of the IP’s geographical location.</li>
            </ol>
